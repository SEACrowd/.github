## Hello! 👋

SEACrowd is a community movement project aimed at gathering and standardizing NLP resources for South-East Asian languages. 
This movement is co-initialized by SEA researchers and practitioners across various institution.


### Contributing to SEACrowd

Everyone can contribute, win some SWAG, and become a co-author of our upcoming paper.
Specifically, we have identified four tasks for contributions:

#### 🗃️ Task 1: Submitting Metadata for Existing Public Datasets

You can submit detailed metadata for existing datasets through this form. You will provide important information such as data license, size, language and dialect, annotation method, and so on.

#### 🖥️ Task 2: Building DataLoader

For approved metadata from the previous task, you can help us build HuggingFace’s dataset dataloader to ensure that all datasets in SEACrowd are standardized in terms of formatting.

#### 🔍 Task 3: Identifying Currently Private NLP Datasets of SEA Languages

Unfortunately, some prior NLP research on SEA languages is still hidden behind closed data. Surprisingly, the reason is as simple as the authors not considering releasing the data as an option before!

In this task, you will search for prior research that did not make their data open and fill out a form. Our team will contact the reported work to negotiate the opening of their data with us.

#### 🔓 Task 4: Opening Your Private NLP Dataset of SEA Languages

If you have previous work with closed data (or have been contacted by us thanks to Task 3😉), you can release your data and log it with us. The data will still be owned by you and tied to your previous work, as we are simply creating a catalog of it.

### Points

Each confirmed contribution will be rewarded with points. At the moment, we are finalizing the points system. A general rule of thumb is that the more complex the task is, the higher the number of points it will earn you. Since our goal is to open access to as many NLP datasets as possible, releasing your own private data should earn you a substantial number of points, especially if the languages are rare and the data quality is superb.

Once your points reach certain thresholds (TBD), you will be rewarded with SWAG and co-authorship.
