# Welcome to SEACrowd! :wave:

[SEACrowd](https://seacrowd.github.io/) is a community dedicated to bridging the gap between multilingual AI and Southeast Asian AI and enhancing the quality of AI research and researchers in the region. This initiative is co-founded by Southeast Asian researchers and practitioners from diverse institutions.

> See what indigenous and non-indigenous languages are under our study [here](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-datahub/blob/master/LANGUAGES.md).

Our members have been engaged in AI research in Southeast Asia since 2016. Collectively, our research efforts have transformed the landscape of AI in the region, providing other AI practitioners with access to SEA resources, models, and insights, thereby advancing AI development in Southeast Asia.

- 11/2023 to 06/2024. [**SEACrowd: A Multilingual Multimodal Data Hub and Benchmark Suite for Southeast Asian Languages**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10118). Accepted in EMNLP 2024. [[Announcement]](https://seacrowd.github.io/seacrowd-emnlp-2024/)

- 10/2024 to 03/203. [**Crowdsource, Crawl, or Generate? Creating SEA-VL, a Multicultural Vision-Language Dataset for Southeast Asia**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07920). Under Revuew ACL 2025. [**Project Page**](https://seacrowd.github.io/seavl-dataset/)

## ü§î What's Next?

### üñºÔ∏è SEA Visual Instruction (SEA-VL)

Following the success of our SEACrowd project, we‚Äôre excited to announce SEA-VL, a new open-source initiative to build a SEA-specific vision-language model.
SEA-VL is a large and ambitious initiative, so we have decided to split it into two phases. In Phase 1 of SEA-VL, we collected self-taken, culturally-relevant images with descriptions about the shared image in the respective local language. This dataset was compiled into an open-access SEA-relevant image dataset, the largest of its kind to date. This dataset will serve as the foundation for Phase 2, where we‚Äôll develop instruction-tuning VL datasets and build a SEA-specific vision language model (VLM) using the constructed dataset.

Phase 1 has been wrapped up. [**Project Page**](https://seacrowd.github.io/seavl-dataset/)

Phase 2 is up from May 2025 - Feb 2026! [**Project Page**](https://seacrowd.github.io/seavl-phase2-launch/)

### üåè Special Interest Group in Southeast Asian NLP (SIGSEA)

SIGSEA aims to change that by promoting research, collaboration, and sharing updates on Southeast Asian NLP. This way, in the future, we also can hold our own SEA workshops & events in ACL conferences! üí™

We're collecting expressions of interest for membership. As a member, you'll receive regular updates on research, events, and opportunities in the region.

Everyone can join (no need for ACL membership). **Sign up today to join SIGSEA via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfNiQ6xSq3yMDMITKbmRvkvjQkznpgO3BFfOHa0957sGnmsbw/viewform)! ü´∂**

### üßë‚Äçüéì SEACrowd Apprentice (Pilot) Program

On-going since 08/2024.

This program targets early-career AI enthusiasts from underserved Southeast Asian communities, who are looking to gain their first substantial research experience. Many face challenges such as limited access to research tools, mentorship, and AI developments.

Our program addresses these gaps by providing research problems for participants to solve in small teams, guided by experienced mentors. Through hands-on projects and learning key concepts, participants work toward writing a publication for top AI conferences like ACL. The program also emphasizes critical thinking, collaboration, and academic writing to prepare participants for success in AI research.

# Resources in SEA

Southeast Asia is home to more than 1,000 native languages. Nevertheless, Southeast Asian NLP, vision-language, and speech processing is underrepresented in the research community, and one of the reasons is the lack of access to public datasets ([Aji et al., 2022](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.500/)).
It is essential to greatly increase the accessibility of SEA datasets, promote research in SEA languages and cultures, as well as build more AI models that represent SEA.

We consolidate a comprehensive resource hub, [**SEACrowd Catalogue**](https://seacrowd.github.io/seacrowd-catalogue/) that fills the resource gap in nearly 1,000 Southeast Asian (SEA) languages across three modalities. Find their standardized dataloaders in the [**SEACrowd Data Hub**](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-datahub).

Furthermore, we also build the [**SEACrowd Benchmarks**](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-experiments) to assess the quality of AI models on 36 indigenous languages across 13 tasks, offering valuable insights into the current AI landscape in SEA. Furthermore, we propose strategies to facilitate greater AI advancements, maximizing potential utility and resource equity for the future of AI in SEA.

## Contributing to [SEACrowd Catalogue](https://seacrowd.github.io/seacrowd-catalogue/) & [Data Hub](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-datahub)

Everyone can join and contribute to this initiative.

### :card_box: Task 1: Submitting Datasheet for Existing Public Datasets

You can submit detailed metadata for existing datasets through [this form](https://form.jotform.com/team/232952680898069/seacrowd-sea-datasets). You will provide important information such as data license, size, language and dialect, annotation method, and so on. The approved datasheets as well as under review datasheets will show up and indexed in SEACrowd Catalogue ([web](https://seacrowd.github.io/seacrowd-catalogue/)/[csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ibbywsC1tQ_sLPX8bUAjC-vrTrUqZgZA46W_sxWw4Ss/edit?usp=sharing)).

### :desktop: Task 2: Building DataLoader

From the approved datasheets from the previous task, you can help us build HuggingFace‚Äôs dataset dataloader to ensure that all datasets in SEACrowd are standardized in terms of formatting. You can take a look at the [dataloader guide](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-datahub/blob/master/DATALOADER.md) and [examples](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-datahub/tree/master/seacrowd/sea_datasets) in SEACrowd Data Hub. We will also ping the taken dataloader issues after 2 weeks of inactivity in case there's any trouble.

# I'm still confused. Could you please help me?

Definitely. Please feel free to ask in #discussion-forum so we can help you. :wink:
