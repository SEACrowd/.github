# Welcome to SEACrowd! üëã

SEACrowd is a community movement project aimed at centralizing and standardizing AI resources for Southeast Asian languages, cultures, and/or regions.
This movement is co-initiated by SEA researchers and practitioners from various institutions.

See what SEA indigenous and non-indigenous languages we accept [here](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-datahub/blob/master/LANGUAGES.md).

## Why Is It Important?

It is essential to greatly increase the accessibility of SEA datasets, promote research in SEA languages and cultures, as well as build more AI models that represent SEA.

## Contributing to SEACrowd

Everyone can join and contribute to this initiative from 1 November 2023 to 31 March 2024, win some SWAG, and become a co-author of our upcoming paper. We aim to publish the results of our findings in AACL/EMNLP 2024.

Specifically, we have identified four tasks for contributions:

### üóÉÔ∏è Task 1: Submitting Metadata for Existing Public Datasets

You can submit detailed metadata for existing datasets through [this form](https://form.jotform.com/team/232952680898069/seacrowd-sea-datasets). You will provide important information such as data license, size, language and dialect, annotation method, and so on. The approved datasheets as well as under review datasheets will show up and indexed in [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ibbywsC1tQ_sLPX8bUAjC-vrTrUqZgZA46W_sxWw4Ss/edit?usp=sharing). [SEACrowd Catalogue](https://seacrowd.github.io/seacrowd-catalogue/) is still under construction for now.

Update (2024/03/30): The call for contribution for public datasheet has ended. Form submissions are still recorded, but contribution points are no longer given. Reviewing effort will be allocated to dataloader implementations and private datasheets for now. We will continue reviewing the public datasheet submissions for SEA after SEACrowd ends.

### üñ•Ô∏è Task 2: Building DataLoader

From the approved datasheets from the previous task, you can help us build HuggingFace‚Äôs dataset dataloader to ensure that all datasets in SEACrowd are standardized in terms of formatting. You can take a look at the [dataloader guide](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-datahub/blob/master/DATALOADER.md) and [examples](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-datahub/tree/master/seacrowd/sea_datasets) in [SEACrowd Data Hub](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-datahub). We will also ping the taken dataloader issues after 2 weeks of inactivity in case there's any trouble.

Update (2024/03/30): The call for contribution for dataloader implementation will end on 15 May 2024.

### üîç Task 3: Identifying Private AI Datasets of SEA Languages, Cultures, and/or Regions

Unfortunately, some prior AI research on SEA languages is still hidden behind closed data. Surprisingly, the reason is as simple as the authors not considering releasing the data as an option before!

In this task, you will search for prior research publications that did not make their data open and fill out [this form](https://form.jotform.com/team/232952680898069/seacrowd-paper-with-private-dataset). Our team will contact the reported work to negotiate the opening of their data with us.

Update (2024/03/30): The call for contribution for private datasheet will end on 15 May 2024.

### üîì Task 4: Opening Your Private AI Dataset of SEA

If you have previous work with closed data (or have been contacted by us thanks to Task 3 :wink:), you can release your data and log it with us [here](https://form.jotform.com/team/232952680898069/seacrowd-sea-datasets). The data will still be owned by you and tied to your previous work, as we simply create a catalog of it.

Update (2024/03/30): The call for contribution for opening private dataset will end on 15 May 2024.

## Is there any other way to help?

For sure. You can message one of the initiators to learn about the details.

## How much should I contribute?

Generally, you can contribute as much as you want and as little as you want! However, in order to reward contributors fairly, we came up with a contribution point system.

**Contribution Point**

Each confirmed contribution will be rewarded with points. The details of the contribution point system are provided in [our Data Hub](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-datahub/blob/master/POINTS.md). A general rule of thumb is that the more complex the task is, the higher the number of points it will earn you.

For example, since our goal is to open access to as many NLP datasets as possible, releasing your own private data should earn you a substantial number of points, especially if the languages are rare and the data quality is superb.

Once your points reach 20, you will be rewarded with **merchandise and co-authorship**. For co-authorship, the number of your contribution points will determine your position in the authorship list in our upcoming publication.

Contribution point tracking is now live at [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQDZtJjA6i7JsxS5IlMtVuwOYjr2Pbl_b47yMSH4aAdHDBIpf-CiJQjNQAzcJPEu_aE7kwH4ZvKvPm0/pubhtml?gid=225616890&single=true)!

## Communication Channels

Join us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/XXRHFuvkTA) or [SEACrowd mailing list via Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/u/0/g/seacrowd) to keep in touch and be the first to know the updates!

## I'm still confused. Could you please help me?

Definitely. Please feel free to ask in `#general` on Discord or message one of the initiators so we can help you. :wink:
